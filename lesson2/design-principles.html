                <p>
                    Websites that utilize visual hierarchy are designed in such a way that the viewer's eye is guided to
                    portions of the page in order of importance. Hulu's website is a good example of visual hiearchy.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is clear by the way the website is designed that Hulu's primary focus is to encourage the site users 
                    to sign up for the "Hulu + Disney+ Bundle". This bundle is center of the page with a large green button
                    to sign up. This is followed by the "Hulu Disney+, Espn+" bundle with a less apparent white button to sign up.
                    Lastly, viewers are encourage to click on the "Hulu only" link, which is small, white, and less obvious.

                    When a website design displays white space and clean design, the site appears neat, tidy, uncluttered, and is 
                    easy to follow. White space can be a powerful tool in website design to keep designs simple and uncomplicated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jesshuff.com is a wonderful example of presenting white space and clean design. The layout of the page is simple
                    and easy to follow. The use of white space makes it effortless to focus on the crotch patterns being advertised.
                    The clean design also makes it unchallenging to find website essentials such as tutorials and FAQS.

                <p>
                    When a website follows the rule of thirds, objects that are part of the design are placed on one of
                    the four intersections or in a section of the rules of third grid. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     Breitling uses the rule of thirds
                    on its site by placement of objects and text in the website layout. The image of the watch and the
                    text on the homepage are placed on either an intersection or a section of the grid. The placement
                    of the image and the text makes the wesbite more visually interesting and appealing.
