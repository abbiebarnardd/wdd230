        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p> The target audience for this website is the retirement community of Mesquite, NV.
            The site is produced by West Side Sunny, a local retirement community, and is
            specifically designed for members of that retirement community. The site
            can be utilized by other retirees in Mesquite as well. If a person would like
            information about West Side Sunny events, local events, healthcare, human services,
            local news, schools, and local businesses, they would be considered a target person.

            Mary is comfortable navigating specific websites on her mobile phone and on her desktop.
            Her son has showed her how to navigate West Side Sunny's website, so she is especially
            comfortable on this site. Mary likes to keep to visit with the other ladies in the
            retirement community and participates in the craft activities. Sometimes doctors are known
            to come and go in Mesquite, so she also likes to keep track of what providers are available to her.
